                    <p class="pcon">Sid Meier is a Canadian American game programmer and designer of many popular strategy simulation games most notably Civilization. Meier co-founded MicroProse in 1982 and is a director of creative development for Firaxis Games. <q class="quickInfo">Sid Meier was born in Sarnai, Ontario, Canada. Meier graduated from Michigan university.</q> Meier has on many prestigious accolades in the gaming industry.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Meier founded MicroProse with his partner Bill Stealey in 1982. MicroProse first developed simulation games such as Silent Service and f-19 Stealth fighter. In 1887 the company released Sid Meier's Pirates which began the trend of using Meier's name in the title of the games developed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After releasing F-19 stealth Fighter, Meier decided to work on strategy games. <q class="quickInfo" style="float: left">In 2011, the people search company PeekYou claimed that Meier has the largest digital footprint of any video game designer</q>  Taking cues from games like SimCity and Empire, Meier created Railroad Tycoon, and leter the game hi was most recognized for, Civilization, although he only designed the first installment. Meier left MicroProse and in 1996 founded Firaxis Games along with veteran game developer Jeff Bridges. Today Firaxis Games specializes in strategy games many of which are follow up to previous Meier's titles. In 1996 he developed  a system for Real-Time Music Composition and Synthesis.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Meier is not always the head of a development project that carry his name. For example on games like Civilization 2, Alpha Centauri and Colonization the head developer was Brian Reynolds. On the game Civilization 3 Jeff Bridges was lead, Civilization 4  Soren Johnson was lead and on Civilization 5 Jon Shafer was Lead.</p>

                    <h3 class="arthead">Richard Garriott</h3>

                    <p class="pcon">Richard Garriott was born on July 4th, 1961 in Cambridge, England to American parents and was raised in Nassau Bay Texas. In 1977 Garriott attended a seven week computer camp at the University of Oklahoma . When introduced to his peers Garriott responded to their greeting of "Hi" with "Hello", his friends decided he sounded like he was from Britain so they nicknamed him "British". Garriott carried the nickname with him throughout his career using it to name some of his characters such as Lord British from the Ultima series and General British from Tabula Rasa.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">In the summer of '79 Garriott began to work at a ComputerLand store where he got his first taste of creating a game, he created a game called Akalabeth. <q class="quickInfo" style="float: left">Garriott acted as corner man for professional boxer and friend Jesus Chavez in his first title defense against Erik Morales in 2004</q> The owner of his store convinced him that his game would sell, so he printed up a cover sheet and a manual for Akalabeth, but them in ziplock bags and began to try and sell his game. Although it sold less than a dozen copies one of them made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with Garriott helping Akalabeth sell over 30,000 copies.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">In the early 80s Garriott developed the Ultima series. Originally published by California Pacific sold again in zip lock bags to interested parties. The second iteration of the game was published by Sierra On-Line, as they were the only company willing to ship the game in a box. By the time the series had a third installment the games had a large following, such a large following Garriott and his brother formed Origin Systems, their own publishing company to handle the distribution of their titles.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Garriott sold Origin to Electronic Arts in 1992. In 1997 Garriott coined the term MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) giving a name to the previously unknown genre, Graphical MUD's. In the early 2000's EA canceled all of Garriots projects including Privateer Online and Harry Potter Online. As a result of these event Garriott parted ways with EA forming Destination Games which after the yearlong "non-compete" agreement  Garriott had with EA had ended, Destination Games merged with NcSoft and Garriott soon became CEO of NcSoft Austin.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">While at NcSoft Garriott developed Tabula Rasa, a futuristic sci-fi MMO. <q class="quickInfo">Garriott became the ninth inductee into the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences' Hall of Fame in 2006.</q> Tabula Rasa was not a commercial success and in November, 2008 in a statement on the Tabula Rasa website, Garriott announced he would be leaving NcSOft to pursue other job opportunities. Later, however, Garriott claimed the letter was forged as a way to force him out of his job in which he had no intention of leaving. In February of 2009 NcSoft shut down live servers for Tabula Rasa.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">In July 2010 the Austin district Court awarded Garriott 28 million dollars in his suit against NcSoft, finding that the company did not appropriately handle his departure in 2008.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Garriott founded yet another company in 2009, Polarium, which developed games for the budding social network market. The company will launch a spiritual successor to the Ultima series. On March 2008, Polarium launched a Kickstarter for Shroud of the Avatar. Polarium's objective is to create a story even more immersive than the Ultima series. SOTA is the first in a five game series. The estimated release date for Garriots new title is October , 2014.</p>

                    <h3 class="arthead">Shigeru Miyamoto</h3>
                    
                    <p class="pcon" >Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the more well known game developers. He is the creator of some of the most successful game franchises of all times such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda and Star Fox. Miyamoto was born in Kyoto  and the nature around Miyamoto was a big inspiration for many of his games.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon" >Miyamoto currently head Nintendo's analysis and development branch which handles many of Nintendo's best selling titles. Miyamoto's titles have been on every Nintendo console to day with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines. His games have consistently received critical acclaim throughout his career making him one of the most revered game developers of all time.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Miyamoto graduated from the Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts after graduation Miyamoto was an up and coming Manga artist when Space Invader inspired him to pursue a career in game design. <q class="quickInfo">In 1998 Miyamoto was the first person inducted into the Academy of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame</q> With his new found inspiration Miyamoto got employed by Nintendo, when the company began to expand, Miyamoto was tasked to design the artwork for Nintendo's early arcade cabinets. With Nintendo's failure to break into the American market leave the company nearly bankrupt the president of Nintendo decided to turn all the unsold arcade cabinets into a brand new American friendly game. Miyamoto was in charge of the conversion and Miyamoto created his first hit in Donkey Kong.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Donkey Kong was a success, leading to several sequels in the series. His success quickly earned him work on many other titles such as Excitebike. His next game was based on the character from Donkey Kong. He reworked the main character from Jumpman to Mario, and gave him a brother Luigi. Miyamoto gave the characters the features of plumbers and put them in a New York City sewer style game layout and created Mario Bros.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After Mario Bros. Miyamoto began to work on other franchises like Ice Climbers and Kid Icarus . He soon made another Mario game titled Super Mario Bros. and began work on another game called The Legend of Zelda in both series Miyamoto focused on the storyline and non linear gameplay rather than high scores. In February 1996 Legend of Zelda was released as one of the only games of its time with a robust story and a save feature on rewritable disks instead of a password system.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">With the success of his early titles there was high demand for sequels , as an answer to these demand Miyamoto began work on Super Mario Bros 2 and Legend of Zelda 2: the adventures of Link. <q class="quickInfo">He was so impactful in games that the name of Gary Oak in the pokemon series in japan is named Shigeru</q> Soon after sequels to those games were developed giving Nintendo two of the biggest franchises in the industry at the time. Each game was not only an innovation to the last but was an innovation to their respective genres.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">When the Nintendo 64 launched began making games for the system, mostly from his previously successful titles. His first game for the system was Super Mario 64. Miyamoto found success again with his title as Mario 64 was one of the first games in its time that allowed the player to free roam in a fully realized three dimensional environment . His second game was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Miyamoto initially intended Ocarina of Time to be played in a first-person perspective, so as to enable the players to take in the vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as being able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. However, the development team did not go through with it once the idea of having a child Link was introduced, as Miyamoto felt it necessary for this Link incarnation to be visible on screen. Miyamoto worked on several spin offs during the life cycle of the console like Mario Kart 64, Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask and Mario Party.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After his success in early game development Miyamoto has consistently released games for all of nintendo's consoles in the following generations. From innovating the Mario series further to creating some of the most memorable landscaped in gaming history with the Zelda series, Miyamoto was and is still considered one of the most influential people in the game development industry. Miyamoto has innovated in every console generation and if you look hard enough you can find his influences in many to most of the games on the market. </p>

                    <h3 class="arthead">BioWare</h3>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Bioware is a Canadian company game development company founded by Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk and Augustine Yip. Bioware specializes in developing role playing games and most famously for launching the Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Star Wars: Knights of the old Republic series. They proceeded to make several other successful titles such as Jade Empire, Mass Effect and Dragon Age.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">In  February 1995 recently graduated medical doctors Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip established Bioware. All three had little game programming experience but had done some programming for use in medical school. Their success in the medical field afforded them the funds to found the company. <q class="quickInfo">Bioware started as a company of less than 20 people but as of 2010 the company employees over 800 people</q> To make their first game they pooled resources which totaled to over 100,000 dollars.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Their first game, Shattered Steel was heavily influenced by the MechWarrior games. The demo of Shattered Steel was submitted to ten publishers seven of which came back with an offer. The trio eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment who contracted Pyrotek Studios to assist the game to its completion. Shattered Steel was released the following year to mild praise from reviewers, commending the company on their implementation of deformable terrain and zone damage to specific areas on and enemy.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Biowares founders were interested in both pen and paper and computerized roleplaying game and were determined to develop a roleplaying game as their next title. Interplay financed an exploratory development. Bioware presented them with a demo called Battleground Infinity which later spawned into Baldur's Gate which witnessed a development cycle of three years. In those years the founders continued to practice medicine but as the demand of development grew it caused Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave the medical field. Baldur's Gate sold over 2 million copies after its release nearly matching the sales of Diablo, The success of Baldur's gate prompted an expansion pack Tales of the Sword Coast.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was released in 2000, only 2 years after the original Baldur's Gate. The sequel sold another 2 million copies matching the sales of the first installment. The success of the series was not enough to support Interplay financially causing them to fall into bankruptcy. Following Interplay's failure Bioware began working with Infogames which was later renamed to Atari. Neverwinter Nights was originally to be published by Interplay, but the company lost the license of the game to Atari and part of their Dungeons & Dragons license, to BioWare. After selling their D&D license to Atari, BioWare developed Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Jade Empire. It had publishing relationships with Interplay Entertainment, Infogrames/Atari, LucasArts, and Microsoft.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon"><q class="quickInfo" style="float: left">Between 1997 and 2012 BioWare developed 6 of its own in house game engines</q>In the years following, Bioware released its Mass Effect and Dragon Age series to similar success to its earlier work. Bioware has been revered as one of the most innovative companies in the gaming industry. Whether it be story telling or game play Bioware finds new and exciting ways to deliver its content to its avid fans. </p>

                    <p class="pcon">LucasArts is an American game development company. It was founded in 1982 by George Lucas as Lucasfilm Games, the video game development group of his company Lucasfilms.  During a 1990 reorganization of Lucas companies, the Lucasfilm Games division was renamed LucasArts. George Lucas founded this branch of his company because he was fascinated with video games so he collaborated with Atari to make games for his company.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">The first result of this collaboration was Ballblazer in 1984 and rescue on the fractalus. In 1984, they were released for the Atari 5200 under the Lucasfilm Games label. Versions for home computers were not released until 1985, by publisher Epyx. Lucasfilm's next two games were Koronis Rift and The Eidolon. Their first games were only developed by Lucasfilm, and a publisher would distribute the games. Atari published their games for Atari systems, Activision and Epyx would do their computer publishing.<q class="quickInfo" style="float: left">In 2012 LucasArts parent company LucasFilms was purchased by the Walt Disney Company for 4.05 Billion dollars</q> Maniac Mansion was one of the first games to be published and developed by Lucasfilm Games.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">The first adventure game developed by Lucasfilm Games was Labyrinth), based on the Lucasfilm movie of the same name. The 1987 title Maniac Mansion introduced SCUMM, the scripting language behind most of the company's later adventure offerings. The adventures released in the following years, such as Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders (1988), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure. LOOM and especially the critically acclaimed The Secret of Monkey Island (1990), helped Lucasfilm Games build a reputation as one of the leading developers in the genre. It was often referred to as one of the two big names in the field, competing with Sierra On-line as a developer of high quality adventures. The first half of the 1990s was the heyday for the company's adventure fame, with classic titles such as Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge. Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis (1992) and the Maniac Mansion sequel Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">LucasArts halted adventure game development for the next five years, focusing instead on their Star Wars games. <q class="quickInfo">Along with games LucasArts also developed simulations for the military in the early 90s</q> They remained silent and did not re-release their old games on digital distribution platforms, as other studios were doing at the time. However, in 2002, the company pledged that at least fifty percent of its releases would have nothing to do with Star Wars.  It was not until 2009 that LucasArts returned to the genre. On June 1, 2009, they announced both The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition, a high definition remake of the original game with updated graphics, music and voice work, and Tales of Monkey Island, a new episodic installment in the Monkey Island series developed by Telltale Games.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Then, on July 6, 2009, they announced that they would be re-releasing a number of their classic games, including Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis and LOOM, on Steam. The re-releases were, for the first time, native versions built for Microsoft Windows. This was the first time in many years that the studio had offered any support for its classic adventure titles.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">In 1990, in a reorganization of the Lucas companies, the Games Division of Lucasfilm became part of the newly created LucasArts Entertainment Company, together with Industrial Light & Magic and Skywalker Sound. Later ILM and Skywalker Sound were consolidated in Lucas Digital Ltd. and LucasArts became the official name of the former Games Division. In 1993, LucasArts decided to base a game on the Star Wars franchise.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Since then LucasArts as stuck to making games from their own intellectual properties. Focusing on Star Wars games, LucasArts has produced some of the most well received movie based games in the history of crossover games. LucasArts continues to put out quality games and have branched out to companies like BioWare to help further the success of their franchises.</p>

                    <h3 class="arthead">Nintendo</h3>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Nintendo  is a Japanese multinational consumer electronics company headquartered in Kyoto, Japan. Nintendo is the world's largest video game company by revenue.  Founded on September 23, 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi. It started as a card company, producing business cards for small business like cab services and hotels.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After restructuring Nintendo developed into a video game company, becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most valuable listed company with a market value of over US$85 billion. The name Nintendo can be roughly translated from Japanese to English as "leave luck to heaven".  As of March 31, 2013, Nintendo has sold over 654.1 million hardware units and 4.10 billion software units.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Nintendo was founded as a card company in 1989, originally named Nintendo Koppai and based in Kyoto Japan. Nintendo produced a playing card gamed called Hanafuda. Nintendo's first venture into the video gaming industry was securing rights to distribute the Magnavox Odyssey video game console in Japan in 1974. Nintendo began to produce its own hardware in 1977, with the Color TV Game home video game consoles. <q class="quickInfo">Nintendo's total assets are worth 1.4 Trillion yen</q> Four versions of these consoles were produced, each including variations of a single game (for example, Color TV Game 6 featured six versions of Light Tennis).</p>
                  
                    <p class="pcon">At the start of Nintendo's venture into the gaming world, a student developer named Shigeru Miyamoto was hired. He worked for Nintendo to make several color TV game consoles. Miyamoto went on to create, direct and produce some of Nintendo's most famous video games and become one of the most recognizable figures in the video game industry.</p>
                  
                    <p class="pcon">In 1980 Nintendo launched Game & Watch a handheld video game where each player played on a separate device to worldwide success. In 1983, Nintendo launched the Family Computer (commonly shortened "Famicom"), known outside Japan as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), home video game console in Japan, alongside ports of its most popular arcade titles.

                    <p class="pcon">The Nintendo Entertainment System was followed by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System known as the SNES. This was a 16 bit console following the 8 bit nes and was rivaled in the generation by the Sega Genesis. A console war between Sega and Nintendo ensued.  Although relatively late to market, the SNES considerably outsold the Mega Drive/Genesis. Its market share slipping to Sega and new rival Sony, Nintendo utilized a $185 million marketing campaign, centered around the "Play It Loud" slogan, to revitalize its brand.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">The company's next home console, the Nintendo 64, was released in 1996 and features 3D graphics capabilities and built-in multiplayer for up to four players. The system's controller introduced the analog stick. Nintendo later introduced the Rumble Pak, an accessory for the Nintendo 64 controller that produced force feedback with compatible games. It was the first such device to come to market for home console gaming and eventually became an industry standard.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">The GameCube followed in 2001 and was the first Nintendo console to utilize optical disc storage instead of cartridges.The console was profitable, but sales paled in comparison with the rival PlayStation.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Nintendo continues to release consoles and first party titles to this day. Nintendo has one of the most in not most loyal fan base of any console producing company. Nintendo has developed to most iconic video games and video game characters in the history of gaming.</p>
