In 1977 Garriott attended a seven week computer camp at the University of Oklahoma. When introduced to his peers Garriott responded to their greeting of \"Hi\" with \"Hello\", his friends decided he sounded like he was from Britain so they nicknamed him \"Lord British\". Garriott carried the nickname with him throughout his career using it to name some of his characters such as Lord British from the Ultima series and General British from Tabula Rasa.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">In the summer of '79 Garriott began to work at a ComputerLand store where he got his first taste of creating a game, he created a game called Akalabeth. <q class=\"quickInfo\" style=\"float: left\">Something goes here</q> The owner of his store convinced him that his game would sell, so he printed up a cover sheet and a manual for Akalabeth, but them in ziplock bags and began to try and sell his game. Although it sold less than a dozen copies one of them made it to California Pacific, who signed a deal with Garriott helping Akalabeth sell over 30,000 copies.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">In the early 80s Garriott developed the Ultima series. Originally published by California Pacific sold again in zip lock bags to interested parties. The second iteration of the game was published by Sierra On-Line, as they were the only company willing to ship the game in a box. By the time the series had a third installment the games had a large following, such a large following Garriott and his brother formed Origin Systems, their own publishing company to handle the distribution of their titles.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">Garriott sold Origin to Electronic Arts in 1992. In 1997 Garriott coined the term MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) giving a name to the previously unknown genre, Graphical MUD's. In the early 2000's EA canceled all of Garriots projects including Privateer Online and Harry Potter Online. As a result of these event Garriott parted ways with EA forming Destination Games which after the yearlong \"non-compete\" agreement  Garriott had with EA had ended, Destination Games merged with NcSoft and Garriott soon became CEO of NcSoft Austin.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">While at NcSoft Garriott developed Tabula Rasa, a futuristic sci-fi MMO. <q class=\"quickInfo\">something goes heres</q> Tabula Rasa was not a commercial success and in November, 2008 in a statement on the Tabula Rasa website, Garriott announced he would be leaving NcSOft to pursue other job opportunities. Later, however, Garriott claimed the letter was forged as a way to force him out of his job in which he had no intention of leaving. In February of 2009 NcSoft shut down live servers for Tabula Rasa.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">In July 2010 the Austin district Court awarded Garriott 28 million dollars in his suit against NcSoft, finding that the company did not appropriately handle his departure in 2008.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">Garriott founded yet another company in 2009, Polarium, which developed games for the budding social network market. The company will launch a spiritual successor to the Ultima series. On March 2008, Polarium launched a Kickstarter for Shroud of the Avatar. Polarium's objective is to create a story even more immersive than the Ultima series. SOTA is the first in a five game series. The estimated release date for Garriots new title is October , 2014.</p>";

He is the creator of some of the most successful game franchises of all times such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda and Star Fox. Miyamoto was born in Kyoto  and the nature around Miyamoto was a big inspiration for many of his games.</p> <p class=\"pcon\" >Miyamoto currently head Nintendo's analysis and development branch which handles many of Nintendo's best selling titles. Miyamoto's titles have been on every Nintendo console to day with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines. His games have consistently received critical acclaim throughout his career making him one of the most revered game developers of all time.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">Miyamoto graduated from the Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts after graduation Miyamoto was an up and coming Manga artist when Space Invader inspired him to pursue a career in game design. <q class=\"quickInfo\">something goes here</q> With his new found inspiration Miyamoto got employed by Nintendo, when the company began to expand, Miyamoto was tasked to design the artwork for Nintendo's early arcade cabinets. With Nintendo's failure to break into the American market leave the company nearly bankrupt the president of Nintendo decided to turn all the unsold arcade cabinets into a brand new American friendly game. Miyamoto was in charge of the conversion and Miyamoto created his first hit in Donkey Kong.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">Donkey Kong was a success, leading to several sequels in the series. His success quickly earned him work on many other titles such as Excitebike. His next game was based on the character from Donkey Kong. He reworked the main character from Jumpman to Mario, and gave him a brother Luigi. Miyamoto gave the characters the features of plumbers and put them in a New York City sewer style game layout and created Mario Bros.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">After Mario Bros. Miyamoto began to work on other franchises like Ice Climbers and Kid Icarus . He soon made another Mario game titled Super Mario Bros. and began work on another game called The Legend of Zelda in both series Miyamoto focused on the storyline and non linear gameplay rather than high scores. In February 1996 Legend of Zelda was released as one of the only games of its time with a robust story and a save feature on rewritable disks instead of a password system.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">With the success of his early titles there was high demand for sequels , as an answer to these demand Miyamoto began work on Super Mario Bros 2 and Legend of Zelda 2: the adventures of Link. <q class=\"quickInfo\">Something goes here</q> Soon after sequels to those games were developed giving Nintendo two of the biggest franchises in the industry at the time. Each game was not only an innovation to the last but was an innovation to their respective genres.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">When the Nintendo 64 launched began making games for the system, mostly from his previously successful titles. His first game for the system was Super Mario 64. Miyamoto found success again with his title as Mario 64 was one of the first games in its time that allowed the player to free roam in a fully realized three dimensional environment . His second game was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Miyamoto initially intended Ocarina of Time to be played in a first-person perspective, so as to enable the players to take in the vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as being able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. However, the development team did not go through with it once the idea of having a child Link was introduced, as Miyamoto felt it necessary for this Link incarnation to be visible on screen. Miyamoto worked on several spin offs during the life cycle of the console like Mario Kart 64, Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask and Mario Party.</p> <p class=\"pcon\">After his success in early game development Miyamoto has consistently released games for all of nintendo's consoles in the following generations. From innovating the Mario series further to creating some of the most memorable landscaped in gaming history with the Zelda series, Miyamoto was and is still considered one of the most influential people in the game development industry. Miyamoto has innovated in every console generation and if you look hard enough you can find his influences in many to most of the games on the market. </p>";
