                    <p class="pcon" ><q class="quickInfo" style="float: left"><a href="http://unjadeable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/shigeru-miyamoto_wii.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://unjadeable.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/shigeru-miyamoto_wii.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt></a></q>Shigeru Miyamoto is one of the more well known game developers. He is the creator of some of the most successful game franchises of all times such as Mario, Donkey Kong, Legend of Zelda and Star Fox. Miyamoto was born in Kyoto  and the nature around Miyamoto was a big inspiration for many of his games.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon" >Miyamoto currently head Nintendo's analysis and development branch which handles many of Nintendo's best selling titles. Miyamoto's titles have been on every Nintendo console to day with his earliest work appearing on arcade machines. His games have consistently received critical acclaim throughout his career making him one of the most revered game developers of all time.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Miyamoto graduated from the Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts after graduation Miyamoto was an up and coming Manga artist when Space Invader inspired him to pursue a career in game design. <q class="quickInfo">In 1998 Miyamoto was the first person inducted into the Academy of Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame</q> With his new found inspiration Miyamoto got employed by Nintendo, when the company began to expand, Miyamoto was tasked to design the artwork for Nintendo's early arcade cabinets. With Nintendo's failure to break into the American market leave the company nearly bankrupt the president of Nintendo decided to turn all the unsold arcade cabinets into a brand new American friendly game. Miyamoto was in charge of the conversion and Miyamoto created his first hit in Donkey Kong.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">Donkey Kong was a success, leading to several sequels in the series. His success quickly earned him work on many other titles such as Excitebike. His next game was based on the character from Donkey Kong. He reworked the main character from Jumpman to Mario, and gave him a brother Luigi. Miyamoto gave the characters the features of plumbers and put them in a New York City sewer style game layout and created Mario Bros.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon"><q class="quickInfo" style="float: left"><a href="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17jdp8j6gew6yjpg/original.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17jdp8j6gew6yjpg/original.jpg" class="img-rounded" alt></a></q>After Mario Bros. Miyamoto began to work on other franchises like Ice Climbers and Kid Icarus . He soon made another Mario game titled Super Mario Bros. and began work on another game called The Legend of Zelda in both series Miyamoto focused on the storyline and non linear gameplay rather than high scores. In February 1996 Legend of Zelda was released as one of the only games of its time with a robust story and a save feature on rewritable disks instead of a password system.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">With the success of his early titles there was high demand for sequels , as an answer to these demand Miyamoto began work on Super Mario Bros 2 and Legend of Zelda 2: the adventures of Link. <q class="quickInfo">He was so impactful in games that the name of Gary Oak in the pokemon series in japan is named Shigeru</q> Soon after sequels to those games were developed giving Nintendo two of the biggest franchises in the industry at the time. Each game was not only an innovation to the last but was an innovation to their respective genres.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">When the Nintendo 64 launched began making games for the system, mostly from his previously successful titles. His first game for the system was Super Mario 64. Miyamoto found success again with his title as Mario 64 was one of the first games in its time that allowed the player to free roam in a fully realized three dimensional environment . His second game was Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Miyamoto initially intended Ocarina of Time to be played in a first-person perspective, so as to enable the players to take in the vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as being able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. However, the development team did not go through with it once the idea of having a child Link was introduced, as Miyamoto felt it necessary for this Link incarnation to be visible on screen. Miyamoto worked on several spin offs during the life cycle of the console like Mario Kart 64, Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask and Mario Party.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After his success in early game development Miyamoto has consistently released games for all of nintendo's consoles in the following generations. From innovating the Mario series further to creating some of the most memorable landscaped in gaming history with the Zelda series, Miyamoto was and is still considered one of the most influential people in the game development industry. Miyamoto has innovated in every console generation and if you look hard enough you can find his influences in many to most of the games on the market. </p>
