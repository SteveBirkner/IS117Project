                    <p class="pcon">Meier founded MicroProse with his partner Bill Stealey in 1982. MicroProse first developed simulation games such as Silent Service and f-19 Stealth fighter. In 1887 the company released Sid Meier's Pirates which began the trend of using Meier's name in the title of the games developed.</p>
                    
                    <p class="pcon">After releasing F-19 stealth Fighter, Meier decided to work on strategy games.   Taking cues from games like SimCity and Empire, Meier created Railroad Tycoon, and leter the game hi was most recognized for, Civilization, although he only designed the first installment. Meier left MicroProse and in 1996 founded Firaxis Games along with veteran game developer Jeff Bridges. <q class="quickInfo">In 2011, the people search company PeekYou claimed that Meier has the largest digital footprint of any video game designer</q>Today Firaxis Games specializes in strategy games many of which are follow up to previous Meier's titles.
